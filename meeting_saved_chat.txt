14:07:03	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Oops Fred Brooks
14:09:04	 From Sara : would be possible to have 2 weeks break since everybody is going through a hard time right now. At least to catch up on the work affected by limited access to the lab
14:09:24	 From Ben Shanghai : for those who are confined home, is there any output or input devices we should buy for our arduinos for the next weeks?
14:10:48	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Perhaps previous students can offer their boards from previous years?
14:11:02	 From DilijanLab Azniv : What about the people who are completely quarantined and can’t have access to anything?
14:11:51	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Reminder, virus can live on surface for 3 days.  Quarantine cardboard packages, boards, etc.
14:15:38	 From engineering : MCU is great.  It is cool to see what others are doing .  plus our students used to speak to other students in other labs
14:16:11	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Can we have a list who is sick and pray
14:29:17	 From Saverio Shanghai : there are also dxf

15:46:54	 From Piotr : And wash your hands!
16:01:18	 From Sol Bekic : Ben Eater has a really good YouTube series showing how processors work (and how to build a semi-descrete one) up from transitor level:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU
16:01:33	 From Sol Bekic : (more info here: https://eater.net/8bit)
16:01:48	 From Daniil Koshelyuk : on Boolean logic fun implementation in domino chains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w 
16:02:34	 From Nicolas Lefebvre : This comparison of inexpensive MCUs is really in depth and useful: https://jaycarlson.net/microcontrollers
16:06:56	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Adafruit shut down today
16:07:05	 From Brigette : ^^
16:08:23	 From Nicolas De Coster (ULB) : sometime (P)DIP can be usefull to use the other side of the PCB and make it "double side", thus smaller ;-)
16:08:33	 From AgriLabQuarantineLab Luc : Tutorials of sparkfun/adafruit are great ressources for students.
16:13:47	 From Sol Bekic : There is also a variation called "jtag2updi", which you can use with an Arduino rather than an FTDI cable
16:13:53	 From Ferdi : Arduino Micro as UDPI programmer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9vK_xMt4Ehttps://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCorehttps://github.com/SpenceKonde/jtag2updi/
16:14:09	 From matthewsolah : Any kind of cereal? Will Raisin Bran do it or do the raisins clog up the electrons?
16:21:24	 From Dan Meyer : can I use the atmel-ice to program my first arm progammer?
16:21:46	 From Steven : Yes, you can
16:21:55	 From Dan Meyer : cool I was right sam side thanks!
16:24:15	 From Angel Leon (Yucatan) : With the experience that many of you have, what microcontroller do you recommend to my programmer?
16:25:39	 From Steven : Which programmer did you make? ISP, uPDI, JTAG/SWD?
16:25:53	 From Angel Leon (Yucatan) : isp
16:26:31	 From benjaminscott : Link works for me
16:26:43	 From manuelcorralesarana : What about for Mac users
16:26:48	 From manuelcorralesarana : thanks
16:28:09	 From hyejin : https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.19/site/blob/master/doc/programming_rec/programming_rec_slides.pdf
16:28:27	 From hyejin : This one asked me to log in to CBA and it seems like I dont have an account
16:29:25	 From Nicolas De Coster (ULB) : Does it mean there is no easy-way (for the moment) to do on-chip debugging on AVR-1 family without... Windows?
16:30:37	 From Nicolas Lefebvre : In fact as far as I can tell (I tried to experiment with this last week) there's no obvious way to do on chip debugging without a real Atmel-ICE
16:30:55	 From Nicolas Lefebvre : or at least I couldn't figure out how to use our simple serial-UPDI converters so far
16:31:05	 From Steven : Top pic - ch340g ftdi/updi board. Lower 2 pics - ch330 fetid boards. 8-pin SOIC, easy to fabricate & minimal components.
16:31:15	 From Jani Ylioja : Debugwire, while it's not as powerful
16:31:54	 From Nicolas Lefebvre : 0-Series and 1-Series don't have Debugwire anymore, only UPDI
16:32:04	 From Jani Ylioja : Oh, sorry, right
16:35:35	 From Jesse Chen : core = bootloader?
16:37:23	 From Nicolas Lefebvre : Arduino technically supports (some) C++, i.e. classes, operator new, etc... How much of that you want to use with a few kBs of RAM available is debatable :D
16:41:22	 From Ben Shanghai : what does "faster" mean?
16:42:18	 From Ben Shanghai : faster = faster to program or faster to operate?
16:42:30	 From Jani Ylioja : You'll run out of resources easily with a litle more complicated programs using arduino libraries
16:42:42	 From Jani Ylioja : Hence faster is better
16:43:11	 From Jani Ylioja : it's using less clock cycles for the same job
16:43:29	 From Nasser Owainat : @Ben Shanghai, Faster means faster to operate
16:44:04	 From Steven : Program runs faster. Neil’s example - toggling an output pin - runs faster when program in avr-gcc, much slower when using arduino library.
16:46:12	 From Ben Shanghai : "RC on reset" ???
16:46:41	 From Jani Ylioja : no, filter or slowing down signal
16:46:54	 From Jani Ylioja : resistor  and capasitor
16:48:13	 From Daniil Koshelyuk : what happens if it doesn't turn on properly? just doesn't work or bricks?
16:49:26	 From Steven : Just doesn’t start up properly, program may not work. IC still ok.
16:49:55	 From Daniil Koshelyuk : ok thanks!
16:51:47	 From Jesse Chen : do you have to use arduino to burn bootloader?
16:52:28	 From Quentin Bolsee (ULB) : If you're interested in my hybrid UPDI/FTDI programmer with a D11C http://www.fabacademy.org/2020/labs/ulb/students/quentin-bolsee/assignments/week07/#d11c-updiftdi-programmer-eaglepython
16:53:16	 From Quentin Bolsee (ULB) : it's gonna change a bit though. Stay tuned
16:54:39	 From Steven : You use a programmer, which could be an arduino, your fabtinyisp, atmel ice, etc. Also depends on which chip, which programming protocol it uses.
17:01:08	 From Ben Shanghai : where does it "import" from?
17:01:37	 From Ben Shanghai : all the libraries are also loaded?
17:02:09	 From AgriLabQuarantineLab Luc : wifi and Bluetooth for esp32 , and low power modes
17:02:50	 From Frosti : Would it be ok to use Micro:bit connected to students custom made circuit board and use the micro:bit for bluetooth communication?
17:03:38	 From Steven : You meant import for micro python? Could be precompiled library that’s part of the firmware or source code modules that you have loaded into the memory.
17:04:47	 From Jani Ylioja : if no boards, simulators?
17:04:54	 From Steven : @frosti: for assignments if your lab is on lockdown, to understand the toolchain. Not for final project, you need to make your own boards.
17:05:24	 From Steven : If not access to boards, use Tinkecad circuits - great simulator (for t45 & arduino)
17:05:36	 From Steven : Plenty of peripheral devices.
17:05:40	 From Kris (Aalto Fablab) : There are 3 op-amps in the fab inventory. what are the main differences or any of those is good (for mono audio)
17:06:01	 From Ferdi : My notes from today: https://git.hsrw.eu/ferdinand.meier/fablab/-/wikis/FabAc20_woche08
17:06:24	 From Frosti : thank you Steven
17:06:53	 From Adrián Torres (Fab Lab León) : Thank you Ferdi ;)
17:07:00	 From Steven : The LM4871 is an audio amp
17:07:22	 From Kris (Aalto Fablab) : thanks Steven
17:08:02	 From Jani Ylioja : Kris, outside inventory, lm386 or tl072 would be something to check :)
17:08:29	 From Jani Ylioja : At least I like those
17:08:36	 From Kris (Aalto Fablab) : Cool. I will check all of them. Thanks Jani
17:09:12	 From AgriLabQuarantineLab Luc : For audio amp , the main focus is the 3rd harmonic and noise.
17:09:23	 From Piotr : Hands!!! :P
17:09:43	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : I will probably be shaving my facial hair.
17:10:00	 From Paul's O'Neill - Ohio, USA : Mask will fit better
